# PROBLEM : guess what number the player is thinking of
#
# ALGORITHM : 
# 1. ask player to input the number's remainder of 3, 5, and 7
# 2. find what number has the same remainder of all the inputs the player put in
# 3. tell them the number they are thinking of and ask them to play again
# 4. if they want to play again, bring them back to the beginning of the game. if not, quit the game.

# 
# ERROR HANDLING:
# - if they enter a number larger than 2 or less than 0 for the remainder of 3, then ask them again to input a valid number
# - if they don't enter yes or no, keep asking the question if they want to play again
